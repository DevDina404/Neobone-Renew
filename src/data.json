            "paragraph": "The twilight zone in one's life comes with a package of health problems. More so in today’s sedentary indoor lifestyle, more and more people are prone to Orthopaedic problems even as early as their mid-forties.

Looking back then would be hindsight and may sometimes be too late.<br /> <br /> Our goal is to provide access to world-class Orthopaedic Wellness care at an affordable cost. With our state-of-art infrastructure, dedicated and expert team of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rehabilitation Specialists, Physiotherapists, and support staff, we achieve this goal to perfection.
